      <p>
        India's tax framework provides significant benefits to charitable and religious institutions through Sections 12A/12AB and 80G of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
        However, under the updated regime introduced through the Finance Act, 2020, all existing registrations under Section 12A/12AA and 80G were required to be
        revalidated, with new registrations issued for a limited validity of 5 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first cycle of these revalidations took place in FY 2021-22, and for many institutions, the next revalidation is due by <strong>30th September 2025</strong>.
        This blog highlights the procedure, practical issues, and key compliance tips to help charitable institutions ensure timely and error-free revalidation.

    <div class="blog-section">
      <h4>ðŸ“Œ Key Deadline</h4>
      <ul class="custom-list">
        <li><strong>Last Date to File Revalidation Application:</strong> 30th September 2025</li>
        <li><strong>Period to Apply:</strong> At least 6 months before expiry of current registration</li>
        <li><strong>Assessment Year to Mention:</strong> 2026-27</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="blog-section">
      <h4>ðŸ“Œ Important Practical Aspects</h4>
      <p>While the process seems straightforward, here are some critical points that may cause confusion or rejection if not handled carefully:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Correct Assessment Year Selection</strong><br/>
          Even though current registration is valid till AY 2026-27, select <strong>2026-27</strong> as the AY for filing. If you select 2027-28, you will be required to furnish income details of FY 2025-26, which may not be available yet. Leaving the field blank is not an option.
        </li>
        <li class="mt-2"><strong>Dual Filing Requirement</strong><br/>
          Form 10AB must be filed separately for both 12AB and 80G. While the details remain the same, ensure the correct section is selected:
          <ul class="custom-list">
            <li>For 12AB: Section 12A(1)(ac)(ii)</li>
            <li>For 80G: Clause (ii) of first proviso to sub-section (5) of Section 80G</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="blog-section">
      <h4>ðŸ“Œ Mandatory Documents for Upload (Self-Certified)</h4>
      <p>Depending on the type of entityâ€”Trust, Society, or Section 8 Companyâ€”the following documents must be attached:</p>
      <ul class="custom-list">
        <li>Trust Deed / MOA / AOA (as applicable)</li>
        <li>Registration/Incorporation Certificate</li>
        <li>PAN Card</li>
        <li>FCRA Registration (if applicable)</li>
        <li>Existing 12A and 80G Certificates</li>
        <li>Audited Financial Statements for FY 2021-22, 2022-23, and 2023-24</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="blog-section">
      <h4>ðŸ“Œ Common Issues Faced</h4>
      <ul class="custom-list">
        <li>Confusion regarding assessment year and financial year details</li>
        <li>Forgetting to file both 12AB and 80G forms separately</li>
        <li>Incomplete document uploads or missing self-certification</li>
        <li>Mismatch of data with previous filings</li>
        <li>Delay in response to query raised by department after filing</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="blog-section">
      <h4>ðŸ“Œ Why You Need Professional Guidance</h4>
      <p>
        Revalidation under Sections 12AB and 80G is not just a procedural taskâ€”it involves precise compliance, detailed financial disclosures, and legal scrutiny.
        Errors or delays can lead to cancellation of exemptions, affecting both the trust and its donors.
